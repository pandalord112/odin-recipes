        <p>In order to make good smash burgers we first need 80/20 ground
            beef. The fat will help keep evertyhing nice and juicy. Then we
            need a cheese that melts well, preferably American cheese. 
            Pickles are required and I prefer to use sweet pickle chips.
            Lastly we need onions that we are going to carmalize. 

            Optionally we can add a burger sauce. I prefer to make my own.
            It will include ketchup, mayonaise, mustard, pickle juice, 
            onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper.
